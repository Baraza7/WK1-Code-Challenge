# Speed Detector

This is a small program that outputs the total number of demerited points a driver gets after exceeding the speed limit of 70

## Instructions

The program prompts the user to imput their speed and if their speed is below 70, the program will return "ok" but if the speed exceeds 70, 1 demerit point will be allocated for every 5 km/s over the speed limit. The program should then return the total number of demerited points if speed is exceeded.

#Measurement Scale
if speed is bellow 70 return "ok". 
if speed exceeds 70, add one demerit point per 5 km/s exceeded

#Language used
The program is build using Javascript and HTML

#How it works
The program uses an if-else statement. The program prompts the user to input their speed, the first statement checks if the speed is below 70 km/s, if it is, the program returns the pharse "ok" and then exits the statement closing the program. If the speed exceeds 70 km/s, the program jumps to the else statement calculating the total number of the demerit points and returning tht to the user using the web interface.
